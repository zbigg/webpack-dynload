# Webpack real dynamic load

This is experiment to show that it's possible to implement "truly" dynamic
load of modules from chunks generated by webpack.

Works with webpack4 & 5, with development and production mode.

# Note:

Webpack's builtin support for ES6 `import()` and CommonJS-ish `require.ensure`
relies on static analysis of source files and thus you cannot have pass them
truly dynamic string content.

This experiment shows if we can extract proper information from webpack to have
enough data to know that:
   * for source module A
   * that tries dynamically module "./B"
   * we know which chunks should be loaded
   * and how to extract "module.exports" for loaded module and return to called

Example:

    // webpack.config.json
    entries: {
        index: "./src/index.js",
        screen1: "./src/screen1.js",
        screen2: "./src/screen2.js",
        ....
    },
     optimization: {
        splitChunks: {
            chunks: "all"
        },
        runtimeChunk: "single"
    },
    plugins: {
        new WebpackManifestPlugin(),
        // a little more magic, see ./webpack.config.js
    }

    // ./src/index.js
    const { dynamicLoad } = require("./src/dynamicLoad.js")

    const screen1 = () => dynamicLoad(DYNAMIC_LOAD_DIRNAME, "./screen1")
        // equivalent of import("./screen1") or
        //               require.ensure(["./screen1], (....))
        // but works without webpack's static analysis of dependencies
